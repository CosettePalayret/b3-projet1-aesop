      <h2>The traveller and his dog</h2>


      <div class="main-content">
      <p>A Traveller was about <br>
        To start on a journey, <br>
        And said to his Dog, <br>
        Who was stretching himself by the door, <br>
        «Come, what are you yawning for? <br>
        Hurry up and get ready: <br>
        I mean you to go with me. » <br>
        But the Dog merely wagged his tail <br>
        And said quietly, <br>
        </p>

      <p class="morale">«I’m ready, master: it’s you I’m waiting for. »</p>

        <h2>The fox and the bramble</h2>

    <div class="text-content">
      <p>In making his way through a hedge,<br>
        A Fox missed his footing and caught at a Bramble to save himself from falling. <br>
        Naturally, he got badly scratched, and <br>
        In disgust he cried to the Bramble, <br>
        «It was your help I wanted, and see how you have treated me! <br>
        I’d sooner have fallen outright.» <br>
        The Bramble, interrupting him, replied, <br></p>

        <p class=morale>«You must have lost your wits, my friend, to catch at me, <br>
        who am myself always catching at others.»</p>

      <h2>The old lion</h2>

      <div class="main-content">
        <div class="text-content">
          <p>A Lion, enfeebled by age <br>
            And no longer able to procure food for himself by force, <br>
            Determined to do so by cunning. <br>
            Betaking himself to a cave, <br>
            He lay down inside <br>
            And feigned to be sick: <br>
            And whenever any of the other animals entered to inquire after his health, <br>
            He sprang upon them and devoured them. <br>
            Many lost their lives in this way, <br>
            Till one day a Fox called at the cave, and, <br>
            Having a suspicion of the truth, addressed the Lion from outside <br>
            Instead of going in, <br>
            And asked him how he did. <br>
            He replied that he was in a very bad way: <br>
            «But,» said he, «why do you stand outside? Pray come in. » <br>
            «I should have done so,» answered the Fox, <br>
            </p>

          <p class="morale">«If I hadn’t noticed that all the footprints point towards the cave <br>
          And none the other way. »</p>
